When you open this page in a browser, you should see a (very simple) HTML form. Type in a search query like “Harvard” and click “Google Search”, and you should be taken to Google’s search results page!

How did that work? In this case, the action attribute on the form told the browser that when the form is submitted, the data should be sent to https://www.google.com/search. And by adding an input field to the form whose name attribute was q, whatever the user types into that input field is included as a GET parameter in the URL.
